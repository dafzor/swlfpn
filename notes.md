# Secret World Legends **Fake** _Patch Notes_

These _patch notes_ were written as a thought exercise on how the game could be improved. It focus only on Quality of life and game play changes ignoring any bug fixing or number changes that you'd expect in real notes.

**This document is in no way associated with Funcom or in any way reflects current or future plans for the game and are only meant to serve as a discussion topic.**

Hope I made everything clear, on with the changes then...

## Daily Rewards

* Every 14th reward of the daily login is now a cache key.
* Non patron players maximum potion limit has been increased to 6, however daily refresh will still only replenish 3 potions.

_Intentions: Try to make things a bit more equal and allow more access of cache exclusive items to f2p players._

## Starting Experience

* You're now asked to confirm your class choice has you reach Weapon Master. You'll be able to change your class at will before you leave the Weapon Master room;
* Inside the Weapon Master room players will have all abilities, passives of all weapons temporarily unlocked, there will also be quality training weapons of all types available to be used.

_Intentions: Make it easier to try out all the weapons making it more likely new players pick weapons they truly enjoy._

## Inventory

* Initial bag space has been reduced to 30 bag slots.
* All inventory upgrades now cost Aurum. The price is fixed at 500 Aurum per 5 bag slots and 1000 for 12 bank slots.
* The Council of Venice has added a new short scenario testing Healer or Tank skills. First time completion will award 10 additional bag slots.
* Players that have already spent aurum in inventory space will be given the number of slots correspondent to the new price and any excess aurum credited to their accounts.

_Intentions: Make inventory expansions always feel like solid value, provide some help to players choosing to play tank and/or healers.._

## Item Upgrading

* Number of item levels has been increased at Mythic and Legendary Quality to provide smother feeling progression. The power overall should remain the same but divided by the additional levels.
* Fusion has been replaced by the new overflow XP mechanic.
* Once an item reaches max Level it will still be able to be further upgraded storing the XP in an overflow XP.
* Items quality (including pip upgrades) in exchange for overflow XP and marks. The overflow XP and mark cost is identical to what it previously costed when fusing items.
* Upgraded items now contribute 90% of their total XP when used to upgrade another item.
* Anima Imbue and Fusion Catalyst items can be used for quality upgrades with no cost of overflow XP or marks.

_Intentions: The new overflow mechanic is intended to alleviate some of the bag space issues as well as make replacing gear feel better overall._

## Glyphs and Signets

* The cost to remove a Glyph or Signet now scales with quality:
  * 500 marks for uncommon
  * 1,000 anima shards for rare
  * 5,000 marks for epic
  * 10,000 mark for mythic
  * 20,000 marks for legendary
* Weapon glyphs now affect attacks with both weapons.

_Intentions: This should avoid the feeling of regret when slotting in lesser versions of glyphs and signets while still making them feel as important choice in the later levels._

## Talismans

* Magic and Physical Protection have been combined into a single Protection Stat
* Talismans with Health and Healing power now also have attack power (75% of same level dps item)

_Intentions: To allow healers and tanks to be able to more easily do story content on their higher level talismans while maintaining the ability of mix and matching different talismans._

## Weapons

### Hammer

* Pulverize enrage effect has been changed. When enraged hits target for triple damage generating massive amount of hate, consumes 50 rage.
* Ground Pound will now now give 45% additional hp for 15s when used when you are enraged.

### Chaos

* Turmoil places an affliction on the mobs affect that makes x% of the damage be done on them instead of you.
