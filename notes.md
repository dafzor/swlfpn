# Secret World Legends **Fake** _Change Notes_

These _change notes_ were written as a thought exercise on ways I believe the  game would be better. It focus only on Quality of life and game play improvements ignoring any bug or performance fixing that the game would also benefit from or content additions.

**This document is in no way associated with Funcom or in any way reflects current or future plans for the game and are only meant to serve as a discussion topic.**

Hope I made everything clear, on with the changes then...

## Daily Rewards

* Every 14th reward of the daily login is now a cache key.
* Non patron players maximum potion limit has been increased to 6, however daily refresh will still only replenish 3 potions.

_Intentions: Try to make things a bit more equal and allow more access of cache exclusive items to f2p players._

## Starting Experience

* You're now asked to confirm your class choice has you reach Weapon Master. You'll be able to change your class at will before you leave the Weapon Master room;
* While inside the Weapon Master room players will now temporary unlock access to all abilities and passives of all weapons, there will also be usable level appropriate training weapons of all types that can be used inside the room.

_Intentions: Make it easier to try out all the weapons making it more likely new players pick weapons they truly enjoy._

## Inventory

* Initial bag space has been reduced to 30 bag slots.
* All inventory upgrades now cost Aurum. The price is fixed at 500 Aurum per 5 bag slots and 1000 for 12 bank slots.
* The Council of Venice has a new short scenario testing Healer or Tank skills. First time completion will award 10 additional bag slots.
* Players that have already spent aurum in inventory space will be given the number of slots correspondent to the new price and any excess aurum credited to their accounts.

_Intentions: Make inventory expansions always feel like worth the money, provide some additional space to players choosing to play tank and/or healers so they can store additional set of gear._

## Item Upgrading

* Number of item levels has been increased at Mythic and Legendary Quality to provide smother feeling progression. The power overall should remain the same but divided by the additional levels.
* Fusion has been replaced by the new overflow XP mechanic.
* Once an item reaches max Level it will still be able to be further upgraded storing the XP in an overflow XP.
* Items quality (including pip upgrades) in exchange for overflow XP and marks. The overflow XP and mark cost is identical to what it previously costed when fusing items.
* Upgraded items now contribute 90% of their total XP when used to upgrade another item.
* Anima Imbue and Fusion Catalyst items can be used for quality upgrades with no cost of overflow XP or marks.

_Intentions: The new overflow mechanic is intended to alleviate some of the bag space issues as well as make replacing gear feel better overall._

## Glyphs and Signets

* The cost to remove a Glyph or Signet now scales with quality:
  * 500 marks for uncommon
  * 1,000 anima shards for rare
  * 5,000 marks for epic
  * 10,000 mark for mythic
  * 20,000 marks for legendary
* Weapon glyphs now affect attacks with both weapons.

_Intentions: This should avoid the feeling of regret when slotting in lesser versions of glyphs and signets while still making them feel as important choice in the later levels._

## Talismans

* Magic and Physical Protection have been combined into a single Protection Stat
* Talismans with Health and Healing power now also have attack power (75% of equivalent dps talisman)
* Extraordinary Protection bonus effects now scale based of the player Protection rating.

_Intentions: Simplify item tooltip. Allow healers and tanks to be able to more easily do story content on their higher level talismans while maintaining the ability of mix and matching different talismans._

## Weapons

**Note: I'll only list a few weapons I have experience with and/or see has having issues, if a weapon isn't listed it doesn't mean it couldn't use tweaking just that I don't know enough to have an opinion. Also I totally ignore numbers balancing since that's best left to someone that actually good at math.**

### Hammer

* Pulverize enrage effect has been changed. When enraged hits target for bonus damage generating extra hate, consumes 50 rage.
* Ground Pound will now now give 45% additional hp for 15s when used when you are enraged.

_Intentions: Hammer is currently mandatory tanking weapon, this change intends to keep hammer as a top weapon pick for tanks but make other choices a lot closer and viable at the high end._

### Chaos

* Turmoil places an affliction on the mobs affect that makes x% (based on evasion chance) of the damage be done on them instead of you.
* Immutable effect has been slightly reworked, it now places a shield equivalent to 40% of your HP instead of restoring 40% hp.
* New passive Helter Skelter, turns your dodge into a dash moving you forward 10 meters and slowing enemies as you pass by.

_Intentions: Immutable is by far the strongest tank cooldown which makes self sustain possible, this intends to still keep it has a strong cooldown while still making healers required. Try to bring back a must loved ability._

### Shotgun

* ScatterShot confuses mobs increasing your glance rating by x%.

_Intentions: The basic ability combined with the elite and gear should make it possible to reach 100% glance chance when using Kneecap making shotgun a stronger option for main hand tanking weapon._

### Dual Pistol

* Weapon Gimmick display has been changed by two bullet magazines that show all upcoming matches.
* Using abilities now causes the top pair to be consumed a new bottom one to be generated
* Flourish, Full House, Six Line and all similar abilities now affect the next pair in line and are off the global cooldown.

_Intentions: Pistol gameplay feels very clunky at the moment with timing to use a match changer being small and lag making it worse, this change is intended to make it flow better by allowing the player to plan ahead their ability usage._

### Blood Magic

* Weapon Gimmick has been reworked, gaining corruption or martyrdom no longer gives the user a healing debuff, instead it will place an increasingly damaging dot on the player.

_Intentions: Current blood gimmick makes blood users a liability and forces healers to also spec blood to be able to counter it, turning it in a dot allows all healers to mitigate it's effect wile still discouraging ignoring it._

### Assault Rifle

* Grenades will no longer explode damaging the player when not used.

_Intentions: Grenades are a major component of rifle damage, wasting it is already penalty enough. Has a curiosity [actual grenade launcher rounds don't arm themselves until they travel 14 to 27 meters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M203_grenade_launcher#Rounds), so they would never explode on the user._

## Scenarios

* Scenario hazards and reinforcements fixed per scenario and changed every day on the reset.
* There is now a vending machine at the starting area of a scenario selling a limited quantities of scenario items (turrets, group heals and weapon) for anima shards.
* Scenario items will no longer persist after then scenario ends.
* It's now possible to also solo queue for specific scenarios.
* Wave duration has been reduced to 2 minutes.
* Survivors will now show up as party members in Party frames making it easier to heal them.
* Tokyo enemies will no longer be part of the castle enemy rotation.

_Intentions: Scenario are excessively random making their difficulty too variable. These changes should make them a bit more predictable._

## Dungeons and Raids

* All elite tiers higher then Elite 5 have been removed.
* New tier of dungeons has been added called Nightmare equivalent to elite 6 and above with IP requirement of 500 for all tiers.
* Nightmare dungeons can only be queued with private groups. There is no random option.
* It's possible to Meet Up into a Nightmare dungeon if part of the dungeon group.
* Every 3rd tier of Nightmare a new hazard is added. These hazards will rotate on a weekly basis per dungeon and not all dungeons will get all hazards.
* Some Hazard examples:
  * Horde, all bosses will summon additional enemies reinforcements every 30s
  * Shielding, all enemies will now cast a shield making them immune to impairs/interrupts, can be purged.
  * Filth, upon death enemies will leave a permanent filth pool that does damage.
* Elite 10 raid has been renamed Nightmare working similarly to the dungeon nightmares.

_Intentions: Make harder content require pre-made group to improve group cohesion and completion rates. Increase the pool of available players for harder content. Add variety and challenges to dungeon farming._

## Interface and Controls

* Use keybind now also acts as Confirm (default: F)
* Cancel keybind (default: G) no longer opens Esc menu. It now also cancels cinematic and clears targets.
* Confirmation dialogues now can be accepted or rejected with Confirm and Cancel keybinds.
* Cache and Chest open dialogues can now be opened by pressing Confirm keybind.

* AutoSprint mod has been integrated in the default Interface.
* The party frames have been redesign to closely resemble FiveAlive 2 mod.
* A base scale option has been added allowing the scaling of every UI element to up to 400%, other scale options will add on top of the base scale. 4k resolutions will default to 200% scale.

_Intentions: To smooth out the quirks in the interface and make the game more enjoyable to play._

## Movement

* Jumping has been changed so that players can always jump once even if falling.
* Permanent filth zones (like the ones in tokyo) will no longer remove sprint.
* It's now possible to teleport when swimming.

_Intentions: Jumping can be extremely frustrating, this would make it more consistent at the risk of some potential exploits._
